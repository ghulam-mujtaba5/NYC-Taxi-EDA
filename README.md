## 🗂 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of Course 3 in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It simulates a real-world scenario where Automatidata, a fictional data analytics firm, is contracted by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to analyze yellow taxi trip data for the year 2017.

## 🎯 Objective
To conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that uncovers trends, patterns, and insights in NYC taxi ridership, and to present these findings through compelling visualizations and executive documentation.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Local file: `2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv`
- Source: NYC TLC Trip Records (2017): https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

## 🛠 Setup
  
  ```bash
  # (optional) create a virtual environment
  python -m venv .venv
  # Windows PowerShell
  . .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  
  # install typical analysis stack
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
  
  # start Jupyter
  jupyter notebook
  ```

## 📊 Highlight Visualizations

- Ride duration boxplots – outlier detection and variability
- Time-based trends – daily, monthly, seasonal trip volumes
- Passenger count distributions
- Payment type breakdown – popularity and usage trends

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📄 Final Deliverables

- Cleaned and processed trip dataset
- Visual reports highlighting key usage patterns
- Strategic recommendations for stakeholders
