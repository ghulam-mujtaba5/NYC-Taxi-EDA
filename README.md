📊 NYC Taxi Trip EDA Project – Automatidata
Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate – Portfolio Project

🗂 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of Course 3 in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It simulates a real-world scenario where Automatidata, a fictional data analytics firm, is contracted by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to analyze yellow taxi trip data for the year 2017.

🎯 Objective
To conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that uncovers trends, patterns, and insights in NYC taxi ridership, and to present these findings through compelling visualizations and executive documentation.
